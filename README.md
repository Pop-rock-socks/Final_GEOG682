Shotspotter sensor expansion analysis
May 8th 2020
Robert Klara

## Introduction

In order for the District police to best detect gunshots in the District boundaries, it is to compare the Crime gunshots recorded by
police personnel with the shotspotter detection points to see potential expansion into additional wards for increasing shotspotter
coverage. To do so,  maps showing gunshots per 10k people will be created and comparison the two maps for my analysis for the best ward.
furthermore, an automated tasker for the District police going forward to perform this analysis on a given time interval to compound the
results and make a decision themselves.

## Analysis

Data selected:

Crimes reported in 2017 - This dataset compiles the crimes for the year 2017 from the ASAP (Analytical Services Application) crime report
database from the  DC Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) from opendata.dc.gov

Wards in 2012 - This is a compiled boundary of the wards from 2012 from the DC opendata.dc.gov

Shotspotter Gun shots - This is a compiled result of t he shotspotter acoustic sensors throughout the coverage area in the District of 
Columbia, This is based on triangualtions of 3 sensors to detect locational whereabouts of gunfires to notify law enforcement. 

Two Maps:
I created my maps by overlaying the actualy crime data on top of chloropleth maps of crimes per 10,000 people. Thsi allows visualization 
of the crime itself alongside the totals present in each distrct in comparison with neighboring ward classes.
